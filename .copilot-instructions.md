# GitHub Copilot Instructions for Spotify Music Stats Project

## Project Overview

This project is a web app that analyzes Spotify listening history, providing insights similar to Spotify Wrapped but accessible year-round.

- **Backend:** Django
- **Frontend:** Angular with Tailwind CSS

## Copilot Usage Guidelines

### General Expectations

- Write clean, modular, and well-documented code.
- Follow Angular best practices, using standalone components.
- Ensure Tailwind utility classes are used efficiently.

### Frontend Development

- Use **Angular v19** with **standalone components** (no NgModules).
- Use **Tailwind CSS** for styling instead of traditional CSS/SASS.
- Fetch data from the Django backend using **HTTP services**.
- Ensure **lazy loading** is implemented for routes.
- Implement **RxJS for state management** when needed.

### Code Suggestions

- Prioritize TypeScript types and interfaces.
- Suggest reusable UI components (buttons, cards, charts).
- Recommend optimizations for API calls and performance.
